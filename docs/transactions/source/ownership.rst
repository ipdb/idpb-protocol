A Note about Owners
===================

The public keys associated with an unspent output
are sometimes called the "owners" of the associated shares in an asset,
but the legal entities associated with those public keys may or may not
be "owners" in any legal sense.
The most that *can* be said
is that those public keys are associated with the ability
to fulfill the conditions on the output.

External contracts or other legal agreements
may establish stronger interpretations in specific cases.
