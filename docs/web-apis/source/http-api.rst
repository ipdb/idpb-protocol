HTTP API
========

.. warning::

   Please ignore this entire page for now.
   It's just a placeholder.


This page assumes you already know an API Root URL
for a BigchainDB node or reverse proxy.
It should be something like ``https://example.com:9984``
or ``https://12.34.56.78:9984``.

If you set up a BigchainDB node or reverse proxy yourself,
and you're not sure what the API Root URL is,
then see the last section of this page for help.

.. _bigchaindb-root-url:

BigchainDB Root URL
-------------------

If you send an HTTP GET request to the BigchainDB Root URL
e.g. ``http://localhost:9984``
or ``https://example.com:9984``
(with no ``/api/v1/`` on the end),
then you should get an HTTP response
with something like the following in the body:

.. literalinclude:: http-samples/index-response.http
    :language: http


API Root Endpoint
-------------------

If you send an HTTP GET request to the API Root Endpoint
e.g. ``http://localhost:9984/api/v1/``
or ``https://example.com:9984/api/v1/``,
then you should get an HTTP response
that allows you to discover the BigchainDB API endpoints:

.. literalinclude:: http-samples/api-index-response.http
    :language: http


Transactions Endpoint
---------------------

.. http:get:: /api/v1/transactions/{transaction_id}

   Get the transaction with the ID ``transaction_id``.

   This endpoint returns a transaction if it was included in a ``VALID`` block.
   All instances of a transaction in invalid/undecided blocks or the backlog
   are ignored and treated as if they don't exist. If a request is made for a
   transaction and instances of that transaction are found only in
   invalid/undecided blocks or the backlog, then the response will be ``404 Not
   Found``.

   :param transaction_id: transaction ID
   :type transaction_id: hex string

   **Example request**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-tx-id-request.http
      :language: http

   **Example response**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-tx-id-response.http
      :language: http

   :resheader Content-Type: ``application/json``

   :statuscode 200: A transaction with that ID was found.
   :statuscode 404: A transaction with that ID was not found.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/transactions

   The unfiltered ``/api/v1/transactions`` endpoint without any query parameters
   returns a status code `400`. For valid filters, see the sections below.

   There are however filtered requests that might come of use, given the endpoint is
   queried correctly. Some of them include retrieving a list of transactions
   that include:

   * `Transactions related to a specific asset <#get--transactions?asset_id=asset_id&operation=CREATE|TRANSFER>`_

   In this section, we've listed those particular requests, as they will likely
   to be very handy when implementing your application on top of BigchainDB.

   .. note::
      Looking up transactions with a specific ``metadata`` field is currently not supported,
      however, providing a way to query based on ``metadata`` data is on our roadmap.

   A generalization of those parameters follows:

   :query string asset_id: The ID of the asset.

   :query string operation: (Optional) One of the two supported operations of a transaction: ``CREATE``, ``TRANSFER``.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/transactions?asset_id={asset_id}&operation={CREATE|TRANSFER}

   Get a list of transactions that use an asset with the ID ``asset_id``.
   Every ``TRANSFER`` transaction that originates from a ``CREATE`` transaction
   with ``asset_id`` will be included. This allows users to query the entire history or
   provenance of an asset.

   This endpoint returns transactions only if they are decided ``VALID`` by the server.

   :query string operation: (Optional) One of the two supported operations of a transaction: ``CREATE``, ``TRANSFER``.

   :query string asset_id: asset ID.

   **Example request**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-tx-by-asset-request.http
      :language: http

   **Example response**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-tx-by-asset-response.http
      :language: http

   :resheader Content-Type: ``application/json``

   :statuscode 200: A list of transactions containing an asset with ID ``asset_id`` was found and returned.
   :statuscode 400: The request wasn't understood by the server, e.g. the ``asset_id`` querystring was not included in the request.


.. http:post:: /api/v1/transactions

   Push a new transaction.

   .. note::
       The posted `transaction
       <https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/latest/data-models/transaction-model.html>`_
       should be structurally valid and not spending an already spent output.
       The steps to build a valid transaction are beyond the scope of this page.
       One would normally use a driver such as the `BigchainDB Python Driver
       <https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/py-driver/en/latest/index.html>`_
       to build a valid transaction.

   **Example request**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/post-tx-request.http
      :language: http

   **Example response**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/post-tx-response.http
      :language: http

   .. note::
       If the server is returning a ``202`` HTTP status code, then the
       transaction has been accepted for processing. To check the status of the
       transaction, poll the link to the
       :ref:`status monitor <get_status_of_transaction>`
       provided in the ``Location`` header or listen to server's
       :ref:`Event Stream API <Event Stream API>`.

   :resheader Content-Type: ``application/json``
   :resheader Location: Relative link to a status monitor for the submitted transaction.

   :statuscode 202: The pushed transaction was accepted in the ``BACKLOG``, but the processing has not been completed.
   :statuscode 400: The transaction was malformed and not accepted in the ``BACKLOG``.


Transaction Outputs
-------------------

The ``/api/v1/outputs`` endpoint returns transactions outputs filtered by a
given public key, and optionally filtered to only include either spent or
unspent outputs.


.. http:get:: /api/v1/outputs

   Get transaction outputs by public key. The ``public_key`` parameter must be
   a base58 encoded ed25519 public key associated with transaction output
   ownership.

   Returns a list of transaction outputs.

   :param public_key: Base58 encoded public key associated with output
                      ownership. This parameter is mandatory and without it
                      the endpoint will return a ``400`` response code.
   :param spent: Boolean value ("true" or "false") indicating if the result set
                 should include only spent or only unspent outputs. If not
                 specified the result includes all the outputs (both spent
                 and unspent) associated with the ``public_key``.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/outputs?public_key={public_key}

    Return all outputs, both spent and unspent, for the ``public_key``.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

       }
     ]

   :statuscode 200: A list of outputs were found and returned in the body of the response.
   :statuscode 400: The request wasn't understood by the server, e.g. the ``public_key`` querystring was not included in the request.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/outputs?public_key={public_key}&spent=true

    Return all **spent** outputs for ``public_key``.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

     GET /api/v1/outputs?public_key=1AAAbbb...ccc&spent=true HTTP/1.1

       }
     ]

   :statuscode 200: A list of outputs were found and returned in the body of the response.
   :statuscode 400: The request wasn't understood by the server, e.g. the ``public_key`` querystring was not included in the request.

    Return all **unspent** outputs for ``public_key``.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

     GET /api/v1/outputs?public_key=1AAAbbb...ccc&spent=false HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com

   **Example response**:

Statuses
--------------------------------

.. http:get:: /api/v1/statuses

   Get the status of an asynchronously written transaction or block by their id.

   :query string transaction_id: transaction ID
   :query string block_id: block ID

   .. note::

        Exactly one of the ``transaction_id`` or ``block_id`` query parameters must be
        used together with this endpoint (see below for getting `transaction
        statuses <#get--statuses?tx_id=tx_id>`_ and `block statuses
        <#get--statuses?block_id=block_id>`_).

.. _get_status_of_transaction:

.. http:get:: /api/v1/statuses?transaction_id={transaction_id}

    Get the status of a transaction.

    The possible status values are ``undecided``, ``valid`` or ``backlog``.
    If a transaction in neither of those states is found, a ``404 Not Found``
    HTTP status code is returned. `We're currently looking into ways to unambigously let the user know about a transaction's status that was included in an invalid block. <https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/1039>`_

   **Example request**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-statuses-tx-request.http
      :language: http

   **Example response**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-statuses-tx-valid-response.http
      :language: http

   :resheader Content-Type: ``application/json``

   :statuscode 200: A transaction with that ID was found.
   :statuscode 404: A transaction with that ID was not found.


.. http:get:: /api/v1/statuses?block_id={block_id}

    Get the status of a block.

    The possible status values are ``undecided``, ``valid`` or ``invalid``.

   **Example request**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-statuses-block-request.http
      :language: http

   **Example response**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-statuses-block-valid-response.http
      :language: http

   :resheader Content-Type: ``application/json``

   :statuscode 200: A block with that ID was found.
   :statuscode 404: A block with that ID was not found.


Assets
--------------------------------

.. http:get:: /api/v1/assets

   Return all the assets that match a given text search.

   :query string text search: Text search string to query.
   :query int limit: (Optional) Limit the number of returned assets. Defaults
                     to ``0`` meaning return all matching assets.

   .. note::

        Currently this enpoint is only supported if the server is running
        MongoDB as the backend.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/assets?search={text_search}

    Return all assets that match a given text search. The ``id`` of the asset
    is the same ``id`` of the transaction that created the asset.

    If no assets match the text search it returns an empty list.

    If the text string is empty or the server does not support text search,
    a ``400`` is returned.

    The results are sorted by text score.
    For more information about the behavior of text search see `MongoDB text
    search behavior <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/text/#behavior>`_

Transaction Metadata
--------------------------------

.. http:get:: /api/v1/metadata

   Return all the metadata that match a given text search.

   :query string text search: Text search string to query.
   :query int limit: (Optional) Limit the number of returned metadata objects. Defaults
                     to ``0`` meaning return all matching objects.

Advanced Usage
--------------------------------

The following endpoints are more advanced and meant for debugging and transparency purposes.

More precisely, the `blocks endpoint <#blocks>`_ allows you to retrieve a block by ``block_id`` as well the list of blocks that
a certain transaction with ``transaction_id`` occured in (a transaction can occur in multiple ``invalid`` blocks until it
either gets rejected or validated by the system). This endpoint gives the ability to drill down on the lifecycle of a
transaction

The `votes endpoint <#votes>`_ contains all the voting information for a specific block. So after retrieving the
``block_id`` for a given ``transaction_id``, one can now simply inspect the votes that happened at a specific time on that block.


Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:get:: /api/v1/blocks/{block_id}

   Get the block with the ID ``block_id``. Any blocks, be they ``VALID``, ``UNDECIDED`` or ``INVALID`` will be
   returned. To check a block's status independently, use the `Statuses endpoint <#status>`_.
   To check the votes on a block, have a look at the `votes endpoint <#votes>`_.

   :param block_id: block ID
   :type block_id: hex string

   **Example request**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-block-request.http
      :language: http

   **Example response**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-block-response.http
      :language: http


   :resheader Content-Type: ``application/json``

   :statuscode 200: A block with that ID was found.
   :statuscode 400: The request wasn't understood by the server, e.g. just requesting ``/blocks`` without the ``block_id``.
   :statuscode 404: A block with that ID was not found.


.. http:get:: /api/v1/blocks

   The unfiltered ``/blocks`` endpoint without any query parameters returns a `400` status code.
   The list endpoint should be filtered with a ``transaction_id`` query parameter,
   see the ``/blocks?transaction_id={transaction_id}&status={UNDECIDED|VALID|INVALID}``
   `endpoint <#get--blocks?tx_id=tx_id&status=UNDECIDED|VALID|INVALID>`_.


   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /api/v1/blocks HTTP/1.1
      Host: example.com

   **Example response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

   :statuscode 400: The request wasn't understood by the server, e.g. just requesting ``/blocks`` without the ``block_id``.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/blocks?transaction_id={transaction_id}&status={UNDECIDED|VALID|INVALID}

   Retrieve a list of ``block_id`` with their corresponding status that contain a transaction with the ID ``transaction_id``.

   Any blocks, be they ``UNDECIDED``, ``VALID`` or ``INVALID`` will be
   returned if no status filter is provided.

   .. note::
       In case no block was found, an empty list and an HTTP status code
       ``200 OK`` is returned, as the request was still successful.

   :query string transaction_id: transaction ID *(required)*
   :query string status: Filter blocks by their status. One of ``VALID``, ``UNDECIDED`` or ``INVALID``.

   **Example request**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-block-txid-request.http
      :language: http

   **Example response**:

   .. literalinclude:: http-samples/get-block-txid-response.http

Votes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. http:get:: /api/v1/votes?block_id={block_id}

   Retrieve a list of votes for a certain block with ID ``block_id``.
   To check for the validity of a vote, a user of this endpoint needs to
   perform the `following steps: <https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/blob/8ebd93ed3273e983f5770b1617292aadf9f1462b/bigchaindb/util.py#L119>`_

   1. Check if the vote's ``node_pubkey`` is allowed to vote.
   2. Verify the vote's signature against the vote's body (``vote.vote``) and ``node_pubkey``.


   :query string block_id: The block ID to filter the votes.

Determining the API Root URL
----------------------------

When you start BigchainDB Server using ``bigchaindb start``,
an HTTP API is exposed at some address. The default is:

``http://localhost:9984/api/v1/``

It's bound to ``localhost``,
so you can access it from the same machine,
but it won't be directly accessible from the outside world.
(The outside world could connect via a SOCKS proxy or whatnot.)

The documentation about BigchainDB Server Configuration Settings
has a section about how to set ``server.bind`` so as to make
the HTTP API publicly accessible.

If the API endpoint is publicly accessible,
then the public API Root URL is determined as follows:

- The public IP address (like 12.34.56.78)
  is the public IP address of the machine exposing
  the HTTP API to the public internet (e.g. either the machine hosting
  Gunicorn or the machine running the reverse proxy such as Nginx).
  It's determined by AWS, Azure, Rackspace, or whoever is hosting the machine.

- The DNS hostname (like example.com) is determined by DNS records,
  such as an "A Record" associating example.com with 12.34.56.78

- The port (like 9984) is determined by the ``server.bind`` setting
  if Gunicorn is exposed directly to the public Internet.
  If a reverse proxy (like Nginx) is exposed directly to the public Internet
  instead, then it could expose the HTTP API on whatever port it wants to.
  (It should expose the HTTP API on port 9984, but it's not bound to do
  that by anything other than convention.)
