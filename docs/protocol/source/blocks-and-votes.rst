Blocks and Votes
================

An implementation of an IPDB Protocol server may or may not
include a concept of "blocks" or a concept of "votes."
It depends on the replication and
consensus protocol(s) used by that implementation.

The 0.x and 1.x series of BigchainDB Server
had/have blocks and votes.
See the `BigchainDB Server documentation
<https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/latest/index.html>`_
for more information.
(You can switch to the docs of a different version
using the selector in the lower left corner of the screen.)

.. note::

   Future versions of the IPDB Protocol might be more opinionated
   about the existence of blocks or votes.
