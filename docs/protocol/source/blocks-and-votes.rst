Blocks and Votes
================

An implementation of an :ref:`IPDB-compliant server <Server Requirements>`
may or may not include concepts like "blocks" or "votes."
See the page about :ref:`Implementation-Specific Deviations`.

.. note::

   Future versions of the IPDB Protocol might be more opinionated
   about the existence of blocks or votes.
