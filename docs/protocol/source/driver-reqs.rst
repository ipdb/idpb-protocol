Driver Requirements
===================

An IPDB-compliant driver (or just "driver")
is a software development kit (SDK), library or package
to help software developers write software
to communicate with a network of :ref:`IPDB-compliant servers <Server Requirements>`.
The distinction is that one uses driver software to help make *requests*,
whereas a server provides the *responses* to those requests.
