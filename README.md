# IPDB Protocol Specifications

There's not much here yet. It's a work in progress.

The IPDB Protocol specifications include:

* The IPDB Transaction Specification
* The IPDB Web APIs Specification (i.e. the HTTP API and Event Stream API)
* Maybe more in the future

You may notice that there's no IPDB specification for blocks or votes.
That may change in the future.
