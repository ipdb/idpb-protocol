# The IPDB Transaction Spec

This repository contains the source material
for the IPDB Transaction Spec (specification),
i.e. the formal documentation of what's in an IPDB transaction,
how to construct a valid transaction,
and how to check if a transaction is valid.

There's no IPDB specification for blocks or votes.
That may change in the future.
